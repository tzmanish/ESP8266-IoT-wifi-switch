= Project: ESP8266 IoT - WiFi switch

Control up-to 10 devices from your local network. Devices can also be scheduled to turn on/off at a perticular date-time.

== Installation

=== Step 1: Upload

For example:

1. Change SSID and Password
2. Upload to your MCU using Arduino IDE or CLI

=== Step 2: Assemble

Assemble the circuit following the diagram diagram.png attached to the sketch

=== Step 3: Add devices

1. Connect to the wifi using credentials configured in Step 1
2. open <ipaddr>:80/devices in your browser (use ip address assigned to MCU)
3. Add your devices. Available pins are : 0,2,4,5,12,13,14,15,16
4. The devices can be toggled using gui interface at <ipaddr>:80
